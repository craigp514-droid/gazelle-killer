For decades, chipmakers relied on making transistors in integrated circuits smaller, and packing more of them together, to achieve more powerful and efficient chips. However, all power that goes into these billions of transistors is turned into heat. This heat needs to be extracted, as overheating causes chips to fail and lose performance. With transistors approaching the size of a few atoms, extracting this highly concentrated heat is rapidly becoming a bottleneck for the next generations of computing. In addition, cooling of chips accounts for about 30% of electricity consumption in data centers, causing an enormous environmental footprint. Sustainable and high-performance heat extraction is key to satisfy our ever-increasing demand for computational power.

We are a provider of breakthrough semiconductor cooling solutions. Our solution utilizes a network of microscopically small cooling channels embedded inside the chip, which enables us to extract 10 times more heat compared to the current leading market alternatives, and extract this heat over 50x more energy efficiently. This enables the powerful integrated circuits of the future to break thermal limitations in a sustainable manner.","Computer Hardware Manufacturing","https://www.linkedin.com/company/corintis","Privately Held",,,,,"2026-02-03T16:44:46.071Z",21883

By creating an extensive portfolio of patented and patent-pending hypervelocity technologies HyperSciences developed HyperCore, one of the world's fastest, simplest, and most efficient commercial launch systems. Utilizing artificial intelligence our system first robotically loads and fires objects, next our HyperCore engine continues the process to accelerates the object to velocities greater than Mach 5.

We are revolutionary changing the efficiencies and economics of drilling HyperSciences, since 2015 our company has been partnered with Shell Energy to demonstrate this disruptive technology. We use low-cost chemical energy to accelerate consumable projectiles to hypersonic velocities, allowing projectiles upon impact to break and pulverize hard rock faster, deeper, and through a wider range of conditions. 

We are using this same HyperCore technology to create the Hyper Tunneling Boring and Mining system (HTBM), replacing conventional tunneling methods which typically are slow, and significant capital expense. In most cases each consumable projectile removes over a half a ton of rock per impact. 

When applied to deep geothermal energy our drilling system allows for low-cost access to deep energy. Our ""Energy Anywhere"" geothermal system generates power by quickly and efficiently reaching untapped geothermal resources and converting it into electrical energy that will cause a significant paradigm change in renewable, clean energy. 

In 2018 HyperSciences secured our first contract with NASA by applying the key components of HyperCore's automated system in order to launch payloads to high-altitudes at extreme velocity.

The Project advanced from an early stage in 2010 through two phases of drilling, resource definition and extensive metallurgical test work to completion of a pre-feasibility study in September 2014, updated in November 2015. It is one of only a handful of projects globally to have advanced beyond this stage and amongst the lowest capex in the sector.

In November 2017, Mkango entered into an agreement with Talaxis Limited (“Talaxis”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Group Limited, whereby Talaxis will fully fund a bankable feasibility study for Songwe totaling £12 million (C$20 million) for a 49% interest in the project. Talaxis will also have the option to acquire a further 26% interest in the project by arranging funding for project development. 

In addition, by investing a further £2 million (C$3.3 million), Talaxis may acquire a 49% interest in a new venture to be established by Mkango focused on neodymium alloy powders, magnet and other technologies, including the collaboration with Metalysis announced in September 2017. The latter is focused on advanced alloys using neodymium or praseodymium with other elements for permanent magnet manufacturing. 

Permanent magnets are critical materials for most electric vehicles, direct drive wind turbines and many other high growth applications. Neodymium is a key rare earth component at Songwe.

In January 2018, Mkango received the first tranches totalling £6m of the Talaxis investment

Its forward-thinking view has enabled it to consistently create solutions for its customers that save them money and time, like ION Satellite Carrier, a vehicle that can transport satellites in orbit and release them individually into distinct orbital slots, and a proprietary cloud-based mission control software suite designed to control entire satellite constellations. 

As it looks to the future, D-Orbit is already developing and testing new technologies to extend the life of satellites in orbit, perform active debris removal, enable interplanetary space logistics, and more. D-Orbit is creating an infrastructure that will broaden humankind’s opportunities to operate in space and expand into the solar system.

Spaceplane

Dawn’s suborbital spaceplanes operate much like a fleet of aircraft, taking off and landing horizontally at airports.

The Aurora is a suborbital plane designed to fly 100 km above the Earth and aims to be the first vehicle to access space multiple times per day. An active test flight program of the Aurora spaceplane demonstrator has seen 60+
flights completed. In 2024 the Aurora broke the sound barrier, reaching Mach 1.12 at 82,500 feet, and set a record for the fastest climb to 20 kilometers (65,600 feet).

In-space propulsion

Dawn is now a leading supplier of turnkey green propulsion systems for NanoSat, MicroSat, ESPA, and ESPA Grande-class satellites, as well as actively developing refueling in space with its LOOP program. Dawn propulsion technology often achieves superior performance than traditional hydrazine systems by using a unique, green-propellant combination; nitrous oxide and propylene. Having proven this technology on orbit for both CubeSats and small satellites, Dawn propulsion systems have now flown on Electron, Vega, Falcon 9, and Soyuz launchers with over 150 thrusters in space across 35 satellites and counting.","Aviation and Aerospace Component Manufacturing","https://www.linkedin.com/company/dawnaerospace","Privately Held","NZ","2017","Christchurch, Christchurch","1, Christchurch, Christchurch 8024, NZ","2026-02-03T15:57:41.351Z",46365

At the heart of the NuScale power plant is the NuScale Power Module (NPM), a small modular reactor (SMR) that brings together traditional components—the reactor vessel, steam generator, pressurizer, and containment—into a single, simplified, and fully factory-fabricated unit. Each NPM can produce 77 megawatts of electricity (MWe), and one NuScale plant can house up to 12 NPMs for a total of 924 MWe (gross). This scalability feature is unique to NuScale and allows for customization of facility output to match demand and project economics.

NuScale has achieved a paradigm shift in the level of safety of a nuclear power plant facility—safety comes first, second to none. NuScale’s Triple Crown for Nuclear Plant Safety design ensures that on loss of all electricity to the power station, an undesirable situation for other nuclear plant designs, each NPM will safely shut down and self-cool, indefinitely, with no need for operator or computer action, AC or DC power, or additional water. This capability is a first for commercial nuclear power.
